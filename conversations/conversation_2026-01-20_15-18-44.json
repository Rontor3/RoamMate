The top comments express concern and criticism over the decision:\\\\n\\\\n- \\\\\"Sablog dhoop aur garmi me tadap ke marne wale hai, fir dhundenge chaav kaha hai\\\\\" translates to \\\\\"People will suffer in the sun and heat and then look for shade where?\\\\\"\\\\n- \\\\\"Cut big shady trees and replace them with Palm trees so that people could see the building and hoardings properly. BMC brain\\\\\" suggests that the trees were removed to improve visibility for buildings and advertisements, implying a lack of consideration for environmental impact.\\\\n- \\\\\"This is criminal!\\\\\" directly condemns the action.\\\\n\\\\nThe removal of trees is associated with development and urbanization, which often prioritizes commercial and infrastructural growth over environmental conservation.\\\\n\\\\n**A Local\\'s Guide to Visiting India**\\\\n\\\\nThe post with a score of 876 and 883 (r/solotravel) offers advice from a local\\'s perspective on how to travel safely and enjoyably in India:\\\\n\\\\n### Places to Avoid\\\\n\\\\n- **Uttar Pradesh (UP), Bihar, Madhya Pradesh (MP), and New Delhi**: These states are noted for being unsafe, polluted, and crowded.
