Flights take around 2 hours and are the most convenient option for a weekend trip.\n\nGiven that you mentioned wanting a chill trip, I would recommend booking a flight to Trivandrum airport, which is the nearest major airport to Varkala. From there you can take a cab or bus to your accommodation in Varkala.\n\nTo book the flights, I'll need to know your preferred travel dates. When were you thinking of traveling to Varkala?"

The total train journey would take around 15-18 hours.\n\nBus:\n- There are direct bus services from Mumbai to Varkala, but the journey takes around 24-28 hours. This could be tiring for a weekend trip.\n\nCab/Private Car:\n- You can hire a private cab/car from Mumbai to Varkala. This would take around 22-24 hours of driving time one-way.\n\nSo in summary, the fastest and most convenient option would still be to fly from Mumbai to Trivandrum and then take a shorter taxi/bus ride to Varkala. Let me know if you have any other preferences in terms of mode of travel or budget, and I can provide more specific recommendations."
