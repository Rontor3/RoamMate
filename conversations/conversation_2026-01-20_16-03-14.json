As your travel consultant, let me share my insights.\n\nVarkala is a picturesque coastal town known for its stunning red cliffs and serene beaches. Based on your preference for a chill trip, I've identified some top-rated hotel and transportation options to consider.\n\nFor a luxury stay, [Gateway Varkala](https://www.booking.com/hotel/in/gateway-varkala.html?aid=1610696) offers stunning views of the Arabian Sea and easy access to the famous Varkala Beach. The [Oceanview Cliff Resort](https://www.booking.com/hotel/in/oceanview-cliff-resort.html?aid=1610696) is another beautiful beachfront property with an infinity pool and tranquil ambiance. \n\nTo get there, you could take the train from Mumbai. The [Mumbai to Varkala Shatabdi Express](https://www.makemytrip.com/trains/mumbai-varkala.html) is a comfortable direct service that takes around 6 hours. Alternatively, you could fly into Trivandrum International Airport and then take a 45-minute taxi or bus to Varkala.\n\nDoes this help give you a sense of the options? Shall I look into flight availability and pricing next?"
