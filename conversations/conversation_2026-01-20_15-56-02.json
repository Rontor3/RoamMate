The [Trivandrum Rajdhani Express](https://www.makemytrip.com/railways/trains/2624amd-trivandrum-central-mumbai-central-trivandrum-rajdhani-express.html) is a comfortable option that takes around 9 hours. Alternatively, you could fly to Trivandrum International Airport and then take a 1-hour cab ride to Varkala.\n\nIn terms of accommodation, the [Gateway Varkala](https://www.booking.com/hotel/in/gateway-varkala.html?aid=1610267) is a top-rated luxury resort right on the Varkala Cliff. For a more budget-friendly stay, [Varkala Inn](https://www.booking.com/hotel/in/varkala-inn.html?aid=1610267) offers cozy rooms with great views. Both options provide easy access to the main beach and cliff area.\n\nAs for activities, you'll find plenty of opportunities to unwind. You could start your day with a yoga session overlooking the Arabian Sea, explore the Varkala Cliff and its unique shops, or simply relax on the beautiful Papanasam Beach. If you're feeling adventurous, you can also try water sports like kayaking or parasailing.\n\nDoes this sound like a good plan so far? Let me know if you'd like me to look into any specific flights, trains, or hotels in more detail. I'm happy to provide more personalized suggestions to make your Varkala trip as relaxing and enjoyable as possible."
